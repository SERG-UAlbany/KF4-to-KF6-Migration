- The Aorta carries blood to all of the other arteries in your body. That includes the Heart and Brain.

The reason why vaccines are really important and works is because the vaccines send in a germ (flu, polio chicken pox it can be any germ) that is  weakened, the white blood cells go through, the normal process of killing the germ, and attacks the germ, and marks it with antibodies, and get rid of the germ. And because the white blood cells and antibodies have fought the germ they memorize how to fight off the germ, and are on constantly looking out for that germ. So you will never get the same cold again

Neurons handle walking around, feeling pain, and remembering important things. There are three different types of neurons. The first neuron is sensory neurons. Sensory neurons send  to signals from sense organs like eyes, ears, skin, spinal cord, or brain. The second kind of neurons are called motor neurons. Motor neurons tell muscles to move. The last of kind of neurons are called interneurons. Interneurons are messengers, they send messages between the sensory and motor neurons.

The second nervous system is the automatic nervous system controls heart beat, food digestion, and breathing [brain does the same but this nervous system is like a back up just in case]. The brain is grayish pink, soft, and looks like a walnut. The largest part of the brain is the cerebrum, which takes up four-fiths of the brain. the cerebellum is another part of your brain, which controls balance and coortanation. The right cerebrum controls the left cerebrum and the left cerebrum controls the right side.

Different parts of the brain control different thing like the cerebellum controls movement. The cerebrum controls your voluntary movement. The thalamus sends most messages and the brain stem controls your heart beat, blood pressure and other things that keep you alive. Also the brain stem is connected to the spinal cord which, is like a highway for messages. The Medulla Oblongata is an enlarged continuation of the spinal cord. The Medulla Oblongata regulates the rate and depth of breathing.

Unless the memories are important or remembered several times are stored in the hippocampus. Some memories cam be kept for months, weeks, or years. Two disease that affect your memories are Alzheimers and Amnesia. Alzheitmers disease deposits build up and nerve  cells stop working which, leads to memory loss. Amnesia is when someone can't remember things that happened recently and things that happened long ago. Also drugs and alcohol can severly damage brain/ memory

My opinion is that it was mold or dust or pollen because they are very common allergens. Also if you had a dog, a cat, some other pet, or if you lived near any exotic outdoor animals that you were exposed to (no offense to the deer of the wood!) you may be allergic to animal dander. These are all common allergies.

As for why nothing has happened since the reaction I will need more information on the reaction and some more facts. I will look for an answer in my research.

Yawning can mean that you are tired, but that is because when you sleep your brain heats up fast.  This also brings me to my other research: your body has biological clocks and if you set a real alarm it can cause sleep inertia. Sleep inertia is basically grumpiness when your body is usually awake in a sleepy state. The deeper sleep you're in the heavier sleep inertia. You should get about 7 hours of sleep. So, this is why you shouldn't set an alarm or stay up too late. But, don't  sleep too long or your body will restart it's biological stages and when you wake it will probably be in deep sleep, which will cause super heavy sleep inertia.

Light from far away stars will take longer, sometimes years (years that starlight takes to get to Earth are called light-years). So, correct me if I am wrong, I do not believe the same thing happens with objects on Earth. Everything you are seeing is in real time, and the brain flips over images you see because they're upside-down. But still, it does it very fast. But sunlight and starlight are from a time ago. So if you are seeing a star, chances are, it might be dead already."

how do neurons work?

A lucid dream is a dream that you are in control of. You can control yourself and do anything. Unlike regular dreams, lucid dreams you are conscious of. You know it's a dream and you can usually remember it well. The first lucid dream you get, you might get very excited and wake up. It's hard to get it back then. But, if you are not aware that it's a dream, here are some steps you can take to tell

-Try to watch a clock. Clocks in dreams don't change, so if a dream clock is at 9:45, it will stay at 9:45.

-Try to press your finger through your hand. The density in dreams are messed up and your finger will go through your hand.

-Try to fly. In real life you're not going to be able to fly.

A common synesthetic thing is associating colours with letters, days of the week, tastes, smells, and sounds.
Tastes can also be associated with sounds and smells (i.e. tasting waffles when seeing the colour green, causing synesthetes to say the taste is 'green' and no one will know what it means.) Synesthetes often don't know they have synesthesia, they think everyone can taste colours, thinks Wednesday is purple, ect. until they find out most people can't perceive things that way. A rare type of synesthesia is associating tastes with words. For example, when hearing the word, basketball, you taste pineapples. A test for synesthesia or ideathesia is drawing an angular shape and a round shape and asking the person which shape they would name 'Bouba' and which one they would name 'Kiki'. 95% of people chose Bouba for the round shape, and Kiki for the angular one."

Then your blood picks up the old air or carbon dioxide and brings it to your lungs so you can exhale the air or carbon dioxide."

Also when an adult is trying to sleep is is easier for them to go to sleep because of how much bigger adults pons are. Because the bigger they are the faster they trigger your sleeping and yawning. Also scientists are trying to find out if nerves can get to your pons and that is what triggers nightmares, but i don't know that for sure.

 to the heart ready to be pumped to the body cells. Oxygen blood has lust been through the lungs going to the heart while
 carbon-dioxide blood went through the body cells, back to the heart, then to the lungs to be exhaled. 

Blood keeps your blood cells warm. Blood cells warm. Blood also carries oxygen through your body. 
One more thing that the blood does to help your body cells is it transports nutrients and substances to them.

-CNS: The central nervous system (CNS)controls our body/bodies. It includes our brain. The CNS includes the ANS and SNS (see below). The CNS looks kind of like a tree. The CNS interacts with mostly everything in the human body.
-ANS: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls muscles, organs, glands, etc. It has 3 systems in it, which work together to create the ANS: The enteric, sympathetic,and parasympathetic nervous systems. The enteric nervous system is in charge of the gastrointestinal system (The system that has to do with waste. Say no more). The parasympathetic nervous system is in charge of digesting, and resting. The sympathetic nervous system is in charge of your instincts to danger. [The ANS associates with (like I said) the muscles, organs, glands, etc.
-SNS: The somatic nervous system (SNS) allows you the ability to think. It may sound small, but it's a big job. If you didn't have the ability to think you couldn't walk! It associates with the brain.
-Neurons: 2 types of neurons are efferent and afferent. They carry messages to and away from the CNS. Neurons have many parts. To find out the names of the parts, check out Tyler and I's poster. There are sensory, relay, and motor neurons. Sensory neurons carry signals from different parts of your body to the spinal cord and brain. Relay neurons carry messages from one part of the central nervous system to another. And finally, motor neurons carry signals from the central nervous system to parts of the body. The neurons carry messages across the nervous system. It works with the CNS. 
And that is the end, finally.

We think this because the sensory neurons feel that an object is to hot or warm. Then the sensory neurons send signals to the brain to move your hand (or other part of the body.) The brain sends signals to the muscles, so the muscles can move the part that is getting burned. The sensory neurons help you feel warmness, coldness, and pain........Skin sends info to the brain through the affrent nerve to the brain. The brain sends a signal back through the effrent nerve to the muscles. Also the affrent nerves is a nerve that carries impulses toward the central nervous system. Finally the effrent nerve is a nerve that 
conveys impulses toward or to the muscles or glands. In conclusion, we think the sensory neurons, muscles, brain, and affrent and effrent nerves all help you prevent a burn. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIANS THEN JUST ASK Zoey, Willow, Nick, and or  James"

  Sometimes, my dreams are not from my memory. Memories are caused by neurons aligning into a pattern. This is caused by proteins. 
     However, your theory could be correct. Everyday, your brain is constantly changing your memories. However, when it happens, you're not aware of it. The change makes some of the memories fake! So when you dream, a random memory in the back of your brain could stimulate a random dream. A newer memory could cause a realistic dream, and a older one could cause a world of fantasies.

It is exclusive migraines for pre-teens and teens but it is extremely rare for adults. Once the teen who has it turns to adults it will turn into just very bad migraines. Only 4% (I forgot the number) of population has them. The symptoms include:
Confusion (earning it's title of Alice in wonderland syndrome)
Hallucination
Memory loss
not recognize people
no headaches (only 50% of the time there will be headaches.)
Lightheadedness
Having a hard time distinguishing dreams and reality
Fogginess
Not making sense with words/using weird word combinations (i.e. white cow run sky) 
glassy eyes and dazed
Light sensitivity
spacing out

While the air you breath out has your muscles and organs, carbon waste. A.K.A  Carbon Dioxide.

Question B - Once the air comes in through the mouth and nose it goes through the Larynx, into the Trachea, then to the Bronchial tubes, then into the lungs. Next oxygenated blood goes through the pulmonary artarys, gathers the oxygen then goes back to the heart. The heart then sends the blood through the veins to muscles and organs like the brain, kidneas, triceps, biceps,abs, calves, ECT. Eventully after dropping off oxygen and picking up carbon dioxide, blood goes back to the heart through the veins and into the lungs through the pulmonary artarys to drop off the carbon dioxide and pick up more oxygen so the whole cycle starts again.

Dreams sometimes express wishes or fears, for example if you are worrying about a big test, you might have a dream expressing the fear of failing, or the wish to ace it. It does not always come from memory though, since most dreams are impossible in reality (For example, if you dream of flying about with eagle wings you will know in real life humans cannot fly!). You may see people from your memory, though. Even if you have never met them and you just saw a picture. I agree with George, if you do not know if something is true or not do not say it is true. Also, the part of the brain that controls memory is shut down when you sleep :)"
68543,15/01/23-08:33:50,15/01/23-08:37:56,Mr. Siebel,Nicholas P Darrigo,I've heard that too,"I've heard that your brain changes your memory and proteins help you remember things. But don't these memories have to be turned into dreams? If so, how? Anyone have any input on this?"

The object absorbs a part of the light spectrum and goes into your eyes. Your color cones take part here. They act like a prism, where regular UV goes in, but comes out a rainbow! The object absorbs only part of the spectrum, so only some colors appear. The brain converts the divided UV into what 
we call ""color"".
      ""Color"" is actualy a illusion. Optical illusions you see in books or on the web is an image that finds the imperfections of our eyes. Our senses aren't perfect, so when a certain thing happens that our brains can't fully process, we see (or feel, or taste etc.)a illusion appears.

   My question, what is the real world like? We are limited only by our brains and our senses. so what does the real world like?

This is a theory I found from online research under the idea of the immune cycle. It is not exact. I wanted to show you that allergies move through the blood so I posted it here on the blood view.
1. When you get a cut, bacteria and germs enter your body. If the cut is deeper, it can enter your bloodstream, causing a possible set of diseases.
2. Immune cells go there when an unknown substance (allergy) gets into you and forms an allergen.
3. The cells fight hard and cause a huge response... a.k.a. reaction.
4. Then the cells eliminate the invading substance.
5.The reaction slowly goes away until it has gone completely.
SO, I hope you liked learning about it! Check out more like this on my view... allergies/immune system... and more cool build on facts to come!!

There are three types of cones, red, blue, and green. The light enters the pupil and then the cornea bends it, making the picture upside-down. It passes through the rods and cones which perceive the light and colours. The red, blue, and green mix together to make different colours. Then the picture is sent to the brain who turns the image right side- up before you see it. Also, I do not think there is a colour nerve. "

My red might be a different colour to you, but you have learned to call that colour red and that is how we communicate. Every human isn't exactly colour blind but we might see colours in a different way than each other.  Since there is no way to tell, we are all colour blind in our own ways.

Your brain can make a memorie from a TV show (EX. sponge bob, team titans go, my little pony, and other cartoons). And there is no walking talking sponges no superheroes no talking ponys. but your memorys don't know that. so there you have a dream about sponge superheroes shaped like ponys.

  Heres my version of the process: food goes down your throat
and into your stomach, which breaks the food down into glucose and carbohydrates. Then they go into the intestines, which squeeze the remaining food and mix it with body acids and juices. The nutrients in the food get absorbed. The body produces insulin, a hormone that balances blood sugars so the energy doesn't go in the blood all at once. Yes, the carbs and glucose do provide energy, but the nutrients are absorbed into your body."

You might dream about something strong enough to create something close to a hypnotic suggestions, making you subconscious.  if that happens, you might get up, and imitate your dreams.

Your lrynax is what holds your true vocal cords and your false vocal cords. It is made up of cartilage, muscles, and ligaments   The reason we have false vocal cords is so they can protect the true vocal cords. Also known as muscular fold that protect the true vocal cords.  The false vocal cords don't help with any vocalization, but they help when you are grunting and screaming.  Your vocal folds are 2 elastic membranes that go across the lrynax. When you are talking your muscles tighten up, and push you true vocal cords together.  The true vocal cords vibrate when you are talking. The vibrating makes the sound. The speed of the vibration helps make different sounds. Your lips and tongue help make more complex sounds."

* the least bad fracture a kid can get is a bowing fracture- bone bends but doesn't brake
* the least bad fracture an adult can have is a greenstick fracture- bone is broken on 1 side not all the way threw

The ones I know of are ocular migraine (eye), confusional migraine (the one i have), and just generic migraine. I don't know anyone with ocular migraine but I know that confusional migraine, the chance of having one is 0.02%. I think they happen when the brain produces to much fight or flight stuff that parts of it start to act weird since i know I get photophobia (the sunlight hurts my eyes) and it's not getting much oxygen since I know that's how headaches are caused."

Shreya said that people that are color blind can't see color and they see black and white. But I see color it's just maybe my eyes don't receive the colors correctly. I just want to see the real world's colors, so I can see them correctly or  to see if i am actually seeing colors right. I heard scientists are making these glasses that makes colorblind people see color correctly. It's weird being colorblind, it's almost like you're an alien from a different planet. If you guys can drop some science on how colorblindness works or disagree with me or anything just tell me. (: C, :)"

Skin keeps Dirt, Germs, and other harmful things out of your body, so you don't get sick. I think it's cool that your skin basically protects you from things on the outside, But when it comes to something sharp or dangerous your skin could be cut open Example A: Jack is cutting apples for his 6 year old daughter anna, unfortunatly Jack cuts is finger off that means that the knife when threw his skin, therefor he is sadly now bleeding to death. Mothers are probably very great full there kids have skin, Example B: Laura is 4 she loves the rain, its raining out side she goes outside and slips in mud, she has a scrap and is muddy what can Laura's mom do to help Laura? Laura's mom can get water and dump it on the mud so the mud comes eight off, she can put some Neosporin on the cut and put a band-aid on the cut and it will heal within 2-6 days. If we did not have ski we would sadly be DEAD"

There are actually UV rays coming from the sun that is also called ultra violet. So the primary colors build up ultra violet and the part of ultra violet shines on an object it looks like the color of the part of ultra violet, and since primary colors can build and create any color the color cone will measure the part of ultra violet. So the blue color cone will measure purple, green turquoise and other colors around that. (: C :) "

I get them in school most of the time (i.e. OUT post it) and sometimes at a friend's house. I can't remember a lot because at home I try to eat, and if that doesn't work, Mom makes me sleep. One day I had a 2-day long headache and double doses of  Aleve, Sumatripton, Excedrine, Tylenol, and nothing worked. Could that make me get a worse migraine??"

You also shake a little sometimes when you get scared or nervous, also some people even freeze when they get scared or nervous, and I don't know why, does anybody here know? Therefore I think I have a theory, and I won't be surprised if I'm wrong because this is not my topic, but maybe it's because, everybody has a different body type, but the same human body, so maybe since everybody has a different body type maybe thats why people will either  chatter their teeth, shake, or freeze, or do all at once. Although, they can't help it, maybe they just don't know what to do because they are (not literly) paralized with fear."

When it is dark, your retina will dilate, or expand to take in as much light as possible because there isn't enough light to see normally. I hope this helps :)"
73679,15/01/30-08:49:49,15/01/30-09:02:33,Mr. Siebel,Alexa Madison Gabor,Diagnosis,"You don't need to be diagnosed with synesthesia. But, there are common tests to determine if your really have it, or you just are weird. Two tests include drawing an angular shape, and a rounded shape. The tester will ask the patient to say which one they will call ""Bouba"" and which one they'll call ""Kiki"". 95% of people said that the angular one is Kiki and the rounded one is Bouba. Another test is that there will be a paper with many fives on it. the tester will ask the patient what they notice about them. If the patient is a synesthete, they will say they notice that the fives are forming some triangles and one is backwards. Non-synesthetes will say that one of the fives is backwards. One cannot have slight synesthesia, but different types including ideathesia, which everyone has a little of, and lexicon synesthesia where you associate a sound with a taste. Those are of I remember. Also, most people are born with synesthesia, but they think everyone has it until someone tells them, so you are never to young to have synesthesia."

I think that some people when they are nervous channel all their nervous energy into chattering their teeth or shivering. Also people with a fear of public speaking may freeze because of the fear that they may say something wrong or mess up. Not everyone freezes when they are scared because people have different fears and different responses to those fears. My question is: What makes people afraid of some things and not others?"

Looking at this simple information in basic form, you can see some people won't get migraines, just a headache once in a while. This is all based on genetics.

With a second glance you may have noticed this fact: medicines are preventions. So, they will prevent whatever horrible reactions your genes bring on (for me it's migraines).

I hope you finally saw with a studying eye that genes not only carry through pains, but pain preventions. My question is, What are some ways we can use genetics to find medicines that relieve migraines and other headaches?"

We made tools and stopped being nomadic and created the first villages. We began to evolve into Homo Sapien, what we now know as modern humans. We lost our neanderthal skulls and bones, and became stronger and less hairy. Anyways, we started having technology, taming more animals, building cities until we took over the world."

Then the knowledge advanced because.. I had a now question that was more specific ( What are the various parts of the brain and what are there jobs? ) After that I had a more specific idea going through my head.

we thought about the odd questions like Why is it the brain that controls the body and not the heart? Those were quickly answered with answers like could you imagine pumping blood in your brain!


then the knoledge advanced...
it really advanced with the hardest question ever written on knoledge forum How do dreams work? This question started a lot of seemingly endless was researching it took a month to figure out here is a answer Dreams are caused by your brain because, your brain either repalys, or plays images that you want or do not want to happen, or what has already happened or, what might happen. This note is not a full answer and we are still researching.

in january...
we know are asking a question to bring us to the end of the year researching. the question is more of a topic what is colorblindness. We are headed to the answer."

this question started slow but then started picking up on one day and i got a lot. but it started to slow down again after 2 days. after a while i changed my question to, dreams. i had some background knowledge because it has something to do with the brain. but the only question that came up was there is no important part of the brain all of them are important.



then the knowledge advanced...this topic was a very big phase. every one started to join and i got a lot of facts off of that topic.i stayed on this topic for a while until i was sort of free researching and looking for something interesting


by january
i was everywhere. from color blind to burps and then back to color blind. but every single note i wrote was getting better and better every time."

Journey of thinking:

In the beginning I found a fact that bone marrow was gooey and spongy and that threw me off course. I didn't think it could make blood. So I ask the question. James replied with this note, which is a very good theory:
maybe it [sic] squzzes out the blood. if so i still wonder what the combanation of chemicals are in blood? just a thought.
That started the alpha-thread. Many people replied to this now hot topic. Many theories and research points popped up, such as maybe there are pores in the bone. The knowledge advanced because many people theorized and found new information I also made a SmartArt showing the bone marrow process. The big idea grew and grew until I found this information: stem cells in the bone marrow split apart and form into blood cells. This new info ended the discussion. By January, everyone (except for one or two people) had long since moved on. The alpha-thread still is the biggest thread out there, but long since died off, and it is no longer a hot topic. The blood, veins, and bone marrow view is pretty inactive, except for a few rogue threads with no question and just a fact. I am now researching epilepsy, very far off the topic of bone marrow.

there was no colorblind views just some random vision views.
we couldn't pull together to talk about different theories, it was just a touch of knowledge in a note.
Then the knowledge advanced because...
a bunch of people suddenly got excited about colorblindness. It happened right in the middle of December. We all started posting more theories and facts about being colorblind and the topic started growing
By January...
  Someone decided that we should start a colorblind group. He started to recruit more people to help make the group a success. More people  joined, more facts were posted, more theories were made, and then, the colorblind views were made .

In the beginning... I was interested in vocal cords.  Then I started thinking about burps, and how the sound of the burp is amplified. I wanted to know if the burp goes through the larynx. 

Then my Knowledge advanced because......I wrote this note""Did you know that when you breath, you suck in gases.  Your body wants to get out the gases, so you burp.  Also when you drink a liquid, the liquid contains extra gases. That is why you burp when you drink a liquid.  Finally if you drink a liquid to fast your body needs to get out the gases.""  I read this note from Skyler and it got me even more interested in burps. ""Some foods and drinks make you burp such as carbonated drinks, foods in high starch, sugar, or fiber that causes gas. Foods are beans, broccoli, peas, onions, cabbage, cauliflower, bananas, raisins, and whole wheat bread. Some medications also could cause a burp."""

In the beginning... we started with talking about the immune system,but no one knew much about it. The notes were shorter, and less advanced. We were trying to find a definition for Immune. Here is a note from september:

   By: Joanna Dorcas Andrews At : 2014-09-26 04:27
If you get chicken pox when you are little, you will most likely never get it again. that means you are immune to chicken pox. When you are immune to a germ your cells can recognize it and kill it before it can make you sick.
Then the Knowledge advanced because... Now that people knew what Immune was, they started leaning toward studying Allergies. At first the notes were not very advanced, but as we continued our research they got a lot better. For example, this note is from when we started studying Allergies:
 
Not my study point (View:Siebel: How Does the Immune System Work?)
By: Alexa Madison Gabor At : 2014-10-30 23:48
But it's a flaw in the immune system when something enters the body and your body mistakes it for an intruder and makes antibodies to attack it when really it can't do anything.
      Here is a note from after we had done research on Allergies:        

Allergy 3 (View:Siebel: How Does the Immune System Work?)
By: Nellie Grace Cordi At : 2015-01-16 09:01
This is all because of the ""unknown substance"". When you get seasonal allergies (i.e. autumn), the leaves from maple trees bother your sinuses... they are getting your nose to run, or maybe even tickle, and sometimes you get sick. Histamine is in your body. That's when your parents make you take a medicine called an antihistamine to fight off allergens and reactions in your body. The reactions are really just overreactions to an ""unknown substance"". If you are allergic to maple trees, you should not be out much in fall! 
          In the end, studying Allergies led us to the topic of Migraines. Our research helped us make theories. Here is an advanced note from our research for Migraines:
Alice in wonderland syndrome (View:Siebel: Brain)

By: Alexa Madison Gabor At : 2015-01-23 08:12

I can tell you about a neurological thing called Alice in wonderland syndrome, more commonly called ACM (acute confusional migraine). It is exclusive migraines for pre-teens and teens but it is extremely rare for adults. Once the teen who has it turns to adults it will turn into just very bad migraines. Only 4% (I forgot the number) of population has them. The symptoms include: 
Confusion (earning it's title of Alice in wonderland syndrome) 
Hallucination 
Memory loss 
not recognize people 
no headaches (only 50% of the time there will be headaches.) 
Lightheadedness 
Having a hard time distinguishing dreams and reality 
Fogginess 
Not making sense with words/using weird word combinations (i.e. white cow run sky) 
glassy eyes and dazed 
Light sensitivity 
spacing out 
Anyways, my question is how does this happen? What in the brain makes this response happen? I have alice in wonderland syndrome but I take medications. I listed the symptoms of my own time. It is different for each person.


My Journey of thinking started with the Immune system, traveled on to Allergies, and is currently in Migraines."

through september to October there were only 2 notes on my topic.The 2 notes where both talking about the brain sending messages and about the muscles.Therefore the notes where small and short.Consequently the class was not interested in the the question.

someone made a note about when you see someone/something your brain  would register it.Sometimes you may not even know the person.This person can even be in your dream... 


By January...
there was more people searching on memory and longer notes.One person said that the memory is a part of your dreams because when you see something you attend to remember it. "

Hear are some facts on bones that I learned 
* bones heal by the body producing many new cells that cover both ends of the bone until the ends are fused together again 
* there are 7 different types of fractures 
* the worst fractures are called either a comminuted fracture- bone is broken in more than 2 places or shattered, or a open fracture- bone is sticking threw the skin 
* the least bad fracture a kid can get is a bowing fracture- bone bends but doesn't brake 
* the least bad fracture an adult can have is a greenstick fracture- bone is broken on 1 side not all the way threw 
* also sometimes people will pass out, feel dissy, or be cold

The knowledge advanced because I went out and did some research on my own to figer out my questions."

Journey of thinking...

In the beggining...I was intrested in the prosses of a burp. There was a group for that which was me willow and christian. We all had really got in to it and we started to run out of facts. Then christan went to another group and me and willow wanted to come up with another question. The question was What are vocal cords? We let lauren join our group, so we had lots of facts about vocal cords. And made a poster. 
Now I realize theres more to learn about vocal cords and me and willow are still searching about vocal cords."

But I came up with a questin and that questin was ""why do you have blood in my body"". Then I started to research blood. Then the knowledge entered my brain.


 Because I reseach more about blood. Then I learnd about white blood cells and killer cells.


  I knew about a new name for  white blood cells that name was leukoctes. I knew about neutrophil,I knew about plasma.        "

At the beginning of the year, I studied blood and the circulatory system. I did his for only a little while because I felt that my thinking was not advancing. My notes were very simple.
Then we did the group research. My question was about bodily chemical reaction. I was then put in a group...
So I moved on to allergies. I enjoyed working on it because it was something I could learn about easily. I did this most of the year. My advanced notes were like this: 
Yes, your DNA and genes have something to do with your allergies, and how you react to them. If one of your parents has an allergy, there is a 30% chance you will have that allergy. If both of your parents have an allergy it is a 70% chance. My theory is that you could also have similar allergic reactions to these allergies compared to your parents.
By January (literally), I was studying migraines. My knowledge advanced because I was researching something I was really interested in. I have migraines personally, and I feel as if I am starting to solve my problems. It gives me a positive feeling. My latest notes have been like this:
I get these massive headaches and they are sharp and they sting. The doctor calls them migraines, phenomenon of the brain. I went to the hospital and they treated me with an I. V. 
My thinking evolved because I thought about what would be of my most interest and of what I am actually experiencing.

As we've discussed, it'd be helpful to use the scaffolds for reflective noticing and envisioning to sharing our reflections on the inquiry process in each week. Depending on your time and the progress of classroom work, please write 1-2 notes about the knowledge building work in each room. Please select the scaffold set Teacher Noticing and Envisioning and choose scaffold supports that are relevant. I suggest that you begin each week's reflection with the scaffold A Snapshot of the Recent Work, to summarize/highlight the major work of the students. Then you may write about any important going-ons you've noticed and will respond to. When you write about a problem/advance/misconception reflected in a student note, you can add reference to this note.

I hope that this reflection will help each of us individually as well as our learning as a whole team."

During the Ice Age, humans (cave men) had no civilization at all. They lived in caves, banged sticks on the ground, and spent their time chasing wooly mammoths. Very civilized... :-)
Then came the Middle Ages... humans became polite. They learned table manners. In the early 1900s, children were taught very well. QUESTIONS: How did we become polite? How did we learn manners?
Now, children are totally uncivilized. Yes, we all know right from wrong, but do we know when we are acting rude or cruel? I don't believe any of us notice when we feel mad or upset, or when we all are talking and someone gets an opposing response.
---HOW WILL THIS CHANGE HUMANS IN THE FUTURE---
This will make us go into war. We all have seen it on the news very often, and it's not okay. We can't do anything as kids... or can we?

People are not as active as they used to be and most people need to add exercise into their lives. Being active can make you feel:
Energetic, strong and healthy.
Able to do the 'every-day' activities of your life more easily.
Great - physical activity releases endorphins - these are the body's natural ""feel good"" chemicals.
Less stressed. Exercise can improve mental health and reduce depression.
Strong. Your muscles become stronger with more physical activity.
Less tired. You'll have a better night's sleep if you are regularly active.
Good about yourself, through better self-esteem and confidence.
You can also make friends through sports.
Any physical activity that involves an impact, eg walking, running, aerobics etc, helps to keep calcium in your bones, keeping them stronger for longer. This will make you stand tall and strong and help prevent osteoporosis when you're older.
Physical activity also means a strong heart and lungs - they'll last longer - and so will you! Exercise can lower your blood pressure and 'bad cholesterol', so you'll stay healthier in later years.

Starting out
It may seem hard at first, but the more you do, the more you will feel like doing.
Start slowly and build up. A very common reason why people don't keep exercising is that they started out doing too much too soon.
Try something new with a friend - it can be fun, and can keep you both motivated.
Do something you enjoy.
If you have had health problems you might want to get a check up before starting a new activity.

Choosing the right kind
Team sports can be a great way of having fun and improving your fitness at the same time. This can be a good way of making new friends.
Some people prefer individual activities that they can do whenever and however they want, such as bike riding, swimming or walking. 
Some people find dance classes a lot of fun.
There are many other activities you can do with a friend anytime, such as walking on the beach, a park or through the bush, having a game of golf or tennis, or swimming. Go roller blading, skate boarding, kick a ball around, or ""shoot hoops"".
There are holidays built around fun activities like skiing or wild adventure type holidays where you take in white water rafting, canoeing, mountain hiking and abseiling for example. You can also get involved in these kinds of activities on a one-off basis.
Try your local gym - most local gyms and many community centres offer organised fitness classes. You should have finished growing before using weights. Community centres may offer activities such as yoga, tai chi and self defence classes which can be cheaper than gyms.
How much?
At least 60 minutes of physical activity every day is recommended. This can built up throughout the day with a variety of activities. Physical activity should be done at moderate to vigorous intensity.               
Vigorous activities are those that make you ""huff and puff"". For additional health benefits, try to include 20 minutes or more of vigorous activity at least three to four days a week.

Avoiding injury
Start exercising at a moderate level and build up slowly. Do the training needed so that your muscles are ready for the extra work they need to do.
It is important to do some warm up exercises before you begin. Warming up prepares the body and reduces the chances of getting cramps or serious injuries. Walking, riding an exercise bike, gentle aerobic movements or dancing are good ways of warming up.
Cooling down properly will reduce the risk of muscle soreness or stiffness the next day. You can use the same kinds of physical activities that you used to warm up.
Stretches should be a part of warming up and cooling down.

The three types of fitness
When people talk about fitness, they are usually talking about three types of fitness. These are stamina, strength and flexibility.
Stamina and Endurance
Stamina or endurance refers to the body's ability to do physical activities for long periods of time. Running, dancing, aerobics, ball sports and other exercises that make your heart beat faster and cause you to sweat increase stamina.
Strength and Power
Physical activities that increase strength are called anaerobic activities. Anaerobic activities aim to increase physical strength, power and muscle capacity, allowing you to perform movements such as jumping and sprinting. Strong muscles also support and stabilise bone joints (such as ankles, knees, hips, shoulders and backs), reducing the risk of injury. 
Resistance training is one way to improve power and strength. Examples are push ups and using weights (start with light ones and increase slowly). 
Flexibility and Suppleness
Flexibility and suppleness refers to your body's ability to perform its full range of movements without pain or restriction. If tendons and muscles become tight you are more likely to get injuries such as pulled or strained muscles and joint soreness. Gentle stretching will improve flexibility.

Don't overdo it
If you are spending a lot of time exercising, you may be overdoing it, which can be harmful to your health and often a cause of serious injuries.
Pain is a sign that you have worked too hard or have an injury ? take notice of it and cut back on how hard you are working or change the activity until the injury has healed. A bit of stiffness and soreness after working hard can be normal, but pain that is severe or which lasts more than a couple of days is a sign of an injury.
Some people push drugs called steroids, saying they can make you fitter, stronger and faster. Taking steroids can be dangerous and have serious side effects. Many drugs are illegal for sports players. For more information look at the Sport Medicine Australia 'Cleanedge'  website.

MRI;  magnetic resonance imaging which uses magnets to look at soft tissues like brain and spinal cord, or blood vessels
x-rays for looking at bones
ultrasounds using sound waves to image soft tissues.
NG tube stands for nasogastric tube used down the nose and into the stomach .
We have come a long way from having to look into an open wound to see how the stomach works like the Dr. Beaumont(sp?)

People with Asthma breath normally most of the time, but during and Asthma flare-up,it can get a little hard to breathe.

The airways, or tubes go into the lungs, and then they get swollen. The airways get narrower, so it is harder for the air to move out of the tubes. The airways also make more mucus, which is the sticky stuff that coats the tubes.

During an Asthma flare-up, a person might cough or wheeze, which means breathing with a whistling sound. The person also might feel a tightness in the chest. When that happens, people use an inhaler during an Asthma flare-up to help them feel better. (Did you know that medicine in the inhaler can work pretty fast, and it can make your body health again).

Trigger
Something that causes an asthma flare-up

People with different types of asthma, have different tigers, like
Exercise
Pet Hair
Plants 
Dust

Strong smells like cigarette smoke or perfume can also trigger asthma attacks

Sometimes, 
Laughing to Hard 
Yelling 
Crying
Can also tigger flare-ups for some people with asthma too. Some people get asthma attacks every once in a while and other people get them more often.

Asthma is not contagious and you can't catch if any one has asthma.

Organs inside your chest that helps you breath.

The lungs are part of the respiratory system which is in charge of breathing.

Inhale
Breathing in air through your nose or mouth

Fresh air rushes down your windpipe, or trachea. The diaphragm, a muscle under your lungs, and that helps bring air into your lungs. Your diaphragm moves down your ribcage, so it pushes out so your lungs have space to fill up air. 

The lungs take oxygen out of the air and into your blood. Your heart pumps the blood through out the body because every part needs oxygen.

Exhale 
Breath out through your nose or mouth

Your diaphragm helps push air out of the lungs. Your ribcage pulls in tighter and that helps push out stuff your body does not really need like the gas, Carson dioxide.

Lungs help you talk. As air pushes out of your lungs, it goes past the vocal chords in you throat. Then the vocal chords make sounds. Your lungs can also help you,
Sing
Laugh
Shout 
Cry
Your lung can help you communicate.

Your diaphragm and lungs help you sneeze to get rid of that tv others that airways in your body."

I learned that when you have a blood clot the is this thing called a filter they put inside your body to get the blood clot to disappear.

However, I haven't seen you since last Wednesday. There might be a limit on the number of key words for searching the KF notes. Because every time the searching engine will do the job separately. If you input three key words in the box, the searching engine will search all notes related to each word. The more keywords you have, the heavier the workload will be. I guess that might be a reason for it, especially when all your classmates are working on it. So my suggestion is that you can search one or two words each time. Meanwhile, we are trying our best to improve the performance of ITM. Hopefully it will solve this problem soon. Sorry about that. And thanks for your question. -Dan "

The Stone Age is divided into three separate periods: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. This was based on how sophisticated the tools humans used were. The oldest recognizable tools were found during this time. They call it the Pleistocene Age. Momentous climatic events occurred.

During the Paleolithic, humans gathered food, hunted animals, and collecting wild fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Tools were made of flint, stone, bone, and antler. Things went from simple to complex.

The tools were called: pebble, bifacial or hand-ax, flake, and blade.

STONE AGE DEFINITION: prehistoric cultural stage, or level of human development, characterized by the creation and use of the first tools.

FUN FACT: Ice Age weather patterns will make a new Ice Age in thousands of years, but it may be warmer than the last Ice Age because of Global Warming and Earth Pollution.

What we see as color is actually a part of the electromagnet spectrum. Parts of the spectrum is what what our brains perceive as ""colors"". The part of the spectrum goes in your cornea, gets focused into the pupil, iris, an lens. Then it goes onto the retina, which senses the part of the spectrum as ""color.  There are only 3 types of ""color"" receptors in the retina, green, red, and yellow. However, many types of spectrum parts can trigger different types of receptors at the same time, causing a color mix, sort of like mixing colors in art. The retina ""translates"" the detected part of the spectrum into electric signals, which goes into the brain. The brain perceives the signals into ""color"".
      But does one brain actually perceive color the same as another brain?
Would my green be your yellow? What is true perception? What is correct perception? Is there even correct perception? Will scientists ever find out?

        Will there ever be an answer to this? I don't think so. But if you find out something that might be close to the an answer, please build on to this.

I read a lot of articles about colorblindness. A lot of them state that colorblindness is inherited from parents. Traits from parents are passed on by genetics, and DNA. 
  So what does this mean? 

  Colorblindness is a mutation.

 Because colorblindness can be passed on, it is likely that it is caused by DNA. However, most people aren't colorblind. Could colorblindness be a mutation?  Probably . Here's another theory.

 The ""colorblind people"" are ""normal"".

 As Christian theorized  , "" but this sounds crazy maybe, just maybe colorblind people are the regular people."" At first I was skeptical, and so was James, and then I thought about this. Could this be true? Could this be a part of evolution? Have humans evolved to see color? This might be true. But if this was so, could there be another sensation right under our nose that we can't sense? 

   We don't know...

It can be very important that we breathe automatically because we breathe when we are sleeping.  when we breathe out ,carbon dioxide enters a nearby capillary.  Blood in the capillary picks up the carbon dioxide and begins the return trip to the heart.  carrying carbon dioxide the blood travels through blood vessels called veins.  the veins deliver  blood to the heart,which pumps it to the lungs.  in the lungs the carbon dioxide leaves the blood by passing through the wall of a capillary.  and and into the lungs tiny air sacks.when we exhale wwe breathe out carbon dioxide then the whole process starts all over again."

There are two types of RNA.
Messenger RNA copies the DNA in the nucleus, then carries the information outside of the nucleus to the ribosomes.
 Transfer RNA carries amino acids to the ribosome for assembly into proteins.
DNA is like the brain of a cell it controls what the cell is meant to do for example if a cell were meant to make proteins for our body the DNA of the cell would know what to do.

Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning.

Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7 million of these people are children.

I also know that the mom and the baby are not connected by their stomachs.  They are connected by the umbilical cord.  That is part of CIRCULATION.  So, that means RESPIRATION and CIRCULATION are working together so that a mom who smokes impacts her unborn baby. Use what you know about breathing and blood circulation to make your next theory."

are you saying that a person's appendix can be removed and then reattached to act as their bladder?  That is fascinating!  My thoery is that it would be a good replacement because it is the person's own tissue so there would be less chance that the body would fight it as a 'foreign' body and work to destroy it like sometimes happens with transplanted tissues.  Now I am wondering how does the body know to turn it from a nonfunctioning, useless body part, to a functionig bladder?  Do you have more information to share or a resource to share about this?"

Natives started farming. They cold stay in one place, so they were no longer nomads (travelers). They had time to build stronger houses, and formed small communities Population grew, so each person could focus on his or her own job.
If you have played Minecraft, its kind of like that, except instead of being pixelated, its in real life. If you find a village, they have a farm or garden, a blacksmith, a chapel, a library, (these were not in existence yet, only in minecraft, which didn't exist either :D ) and a well for water. There were also extra houses scattered around for healers, hunters, gardeners, (librarians :D lol ) gatherers, and weavers. They have plenty of villagers who own chests. They store food in them and other valuables like string for weaving.

My theory is that the Dire wolf didn't use it's teeth as often, but needed more room for it's brain. It's prey may have      
adapted to be unaffected by the wolf's teeth,so the wolf may have needed to be smarter."

It is basically photons (pieces of energy or particles), and mostly moves as waves. White light, or the light from the sun, is made of colors, and colors are different types of light recognized by their own wavelengths. Waves exist above and below the visible spectrum, too. Such waves called radio, microwave, and infrared are below the red end of the spectrum, and ultraviolet (UV), x-rays, and gamma rays are above the violet. These cannot be seen by the human eye, and therefore constitute the ""invisible"" spectrum. Together, the visible and invisible spectrums make up the electromagnetic spectrum."

Very good questions. I was just wondering, what do you think of my research? Please post as a build on to the last person's note on my 'stairway of thinking'. 
So, here it is...
  THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION!!!!!!!!!!
Stone Age means a prehistoric, culture-filled stage, or level of human development, characterized by the creation and use of stone tools. Humans used these tools later on.
This was the beginning of an EPOCH. This means phase, and is said e-poke. This epoch was the Pleistocene era.
Some facts for you...
-sometimes called Quaternary
- is pronounced Play- stow- scene
Animal species were wiped out by a giant flood, the Continental Drift. This not only formed continents, but broke the land bridge, so that you could no longer travel from Asia to Alaska and Canada. Luckily, humans were already on this side of the ocean, and survived. Why? Because they were intelligent and adaptable.
There were jobs during their Nomadic travels. Gatherers collected special fruits, hunters chased wild boar and other animals, and healers doctored the people who were sick or infected with a disease. Soon we were on our way.
AGRICULTURE means things that adapt to help us stay alive.
People soon made tools to hunt and nets to fish. They began forest gardening, which was easier, but you often stumbled upon something poisonous, making the healer that much more busy. The nomads traveled in troops.
People made baskets and pots for necessities. They developed a religion around multiple gods. They got settled in one area, right around anywhere in the North America area. They were no longer nomads, but natives, being that they did not travel.
So the Natives formed little towns, like the early Mayans, and began farming. This helped them to grow food to eat, and trade with other small communities. They built stronger homes, and developed larger towns. Members of these groups could now focus on one job they could do well, and were now civilized.

I really hoped you enjoyed learning. Don't forget to build on! Now time for some research..."

 Position: The position part of kinematics refers to the location of the player on the ice at a given moment. 
 Velocity: The velocity part of kinematics has 2 parts. 1, the players speed. 2, the players direction. An example of why this is part is if a player is going a distance of 64 ft, at a speed of 2.3 secs to go this distance, you can divide the number of feet by the number of seconds to find out that the player went an average speed of 27.83ft per sec.
 Acceleration: The acceleration part of kinematics refers to the change in a players speed/direction over a period of time. Example: if a player has a velocity of 23 ft per sec and an acceleration time of 1.4 secs,  then the players average acceleration is 16.43 ft per sec per sec."

That being said, it's extremely rare. It is also mostly genetic. This brain disorder causes it's victim to have auditory hallucinations, or hear voices. The voices are very negative and criticize or insult the victim. Sometimes, they're are reassuring. Saying things like ""Don't worry"" or ""It'll be alright"". They make it very hard to concentrate on things like, tests, papers, or homework. Oftentimes the victim may not want to socialize with other people, and just start a conversation with their auditory hallucinations. Sometimes they'll even have names for them. Sometimes the voices may tell them to do something bad, like hurt themselves or other people. Victims may also experience visual hallucinations. Luckily, there's medicines for people with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is one of the most serious brain disorder. It causes people to withdrawal from their friends or family, or seriously hurt themselves or other people. Though there is no cure, there is medicine to help people with schizophrenia live happy and healthy lives."
97957,15/05/01-08:34:58,15/05/06-11:08:06,Mr. Siebel,Alexa Madison Gabor,People making light of mental disorders (THIS IS A LARGE NOTE BUT INTERESTING),"Some people try to make light of brain/mental disorders like schizophrenia, psychopathy (sy-cop-path-y), depression, Bipolar Disorder, anxiety disorders and OCD. They don't fully understand what it's like for the people who have to live with these disorders. You've probably heard someone say that something is ""schizophrenic"" because it's paranoid (paranoia is a big symptom of schizophrenia), that their next-door neighbor is a ""psychopath"", that they're so depressed that their favourite store closed down, or that they're ""so OCD"" (which doesn't make sense because you're saying ""you're so obsessive compulsive disorder""). I'll take a look of the truth about the mental disorders. Let's start with the big one: OCD.

OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive disorder) is a mental disorder classified of intense fears or anxieties ""obsessions"" and rituals or processes to get rid of the fear ""compulsions"". A common compulsion is frequently washing your hands, switching off a light a certain amount of times, or opening and closing a door repeatedly. Despite popular beliefs, OCD ISN'T being super tidy. OCD is classified as an anxiety disorder, but there are subtypes of OCD like dermotillomania (Picking of the skin) and trichotillomania (pulling out hair) to relieve anxieties. Not everyone has ""a touch of OCD"" because it (like all anxiety disorders) only affect abut 30% of the population. 

Next I'll explain another big one: psychopathy. Besides OCD, psychopathy is probably the most misunderstood mental disorder. Plenty of people have probably called someone a ""psychopath"" for acting insane. Psychopathy is a serious mental disorder which the victim will do whatever (s)he wants, regardless of the consequence. Victims will have no empathy, even to their close friends or family. They can seriously hurt another person and not care about the consequence or the people around him/her. So you see, a ""psychopath"" would not be your crazy next door neighbor, but a person with an extremely dangerous and serious mental disorder. Luckily there is medicines and help for psychopathy.
 
Next is depression. Depression is the most common mental disorder but often misunderstood. Many people say that they're ""depressed"" that their favourite show just ended, or that their favourite food is out of stock, without really knowing what they're saying. Despite being the most common, depression is very serious. A depressed person will stop feeling happy and can't find joy in even their favourite things. They'll start to lose interest in things normally they love to do, because they no longer find any joy in it. They will feel misunderstood,and like they're going through this alone. Untreated depression for long periods of time can result in horrible things like self-harm or suicide. Depression can be genetic or caused by something like a friend or loved one dying. Bipolar Disorder can also cause Depression, as well as disorders like Sensory Processing Disorder going untreated. Also anxiety disorders can cause Depression going untreated. Next I'll talk about Bipolar Disorder.

Bipolar Disorder (formerly Manic-Depressive Disorder), is a neurological disorder caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. People who have bipolar disorder will go through ""manic-depressive episodes"" which can last a few days or a few weeks. A type of episode is a ""manic episode"", where they'll experience ""Mania"". Mania makes one feel on top of the world, like they're invincible and nothing can happen to them. You probably see the problem in this, because they might take dangerous risks. They'll seem very very antsy and excited for no particular reason, and they'll have a hard time sitting still. Manic episodes are usually referred to as a ""High"" of bipolar disorder. After a High there must be a Low. The low of bipolar disorder is ""depressive episodes"" Hence the name, the person will experience ""Bipolar Depression"". As stated in the depression paragraph, there is all the same symptoms except lasting for less time, and usually followed by a high. Usually a person with bipolar disorder gets medicine for it. They can also go to therapy to help them cope with highs and lows.
 
Anxiety disorders are a group of mental illnesses (they include, General anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, separation anxiety, social anxiety, and Phobia Disorders). Anxiety disorders are fairly common but still a minority, since it affects only 30% of the population. Anxiety is different than fear, since fear is something you feel when confronted with something, but anxiety is worries about something that might happen. Anxiety disorders aren't diagnosed (like all mental illnesses) until the anxiety is affecting how you live your normal life. Anxious people are constantly worrying about things very irrational, mostly things that will never happen. It becomes the only thing they can think about, and they can not shake themselves away from this feeling that something is going to happen. Severe anxiety may result in the person not able to leave their own house. Anxiety is commonly misdiagnosed as ADD, ADHD, and ODD because it makes a person antsy and irritable. Untreated anxiety may result in depression. 

In conclusion, mental illnesses are not something to make light of. So next time you say you're ""so depressed"" about your favourite show, or that someone is acting like a ""psychopath"", think of the millions of people living with these horrible illnesses. Try to take into mind what they're going through, and think before you say. Anyone with any of these disorders would gladly switch places with you. And remember, these are real illnesses. OCD isn't ""all in your head"" and depressed people can't just ""be happy"". Telling an anxious person to just think of something else or depressed person to be happy is like telling a crippled person to get up and walk. In addition, try not to think of a person as their illness. Instead of calling someone a ""schizophrenic"" say that they ""have schizophrenia"". Instead of calling someone a ""psychopath"", just say that they ""have psychopathy"". Thank you for reading this tiny article!"

These chromosomes are essential to organisms and important to traits of humans or any living organisms. Chromosomes are in cells and are the rules for what the cell does. A cell needs to divide to stay alive and it lets your body grow. At the end of a chromosome, there is a thing called a telomere. The telomere keeps information in DNA safe. Every time a cell divides, the telomeres get worn down a little more. When the telomeres are gone, the organism dies."

 The center of mass is the center of an object. when a figure skater does a jump and becomes a projectile the center of the mass (figure skater) moves in a parabola or a curved line.
 When a figure skater spins they use angular to controle the speed. 
Example: 
 When on a spinning chair start spinning. In the beginning spred your arms out wide, then quickly pull your arms in. You will notice that you start going faster. Now put your arms out wide again. You will slow down. This happens because of angular momentum.

Mitochondria disease can affect baby's shortly after they are born.This disease includes the brain, heart, and muscles. The mitochondrial can cause deafness or blindness. Having this disease is hard and very sad.To learn about the mitochondria you have to learn about the cells when they are working and when the mitochondria disease is happening.The mitochondria acts like power plants of the cell."

    pain doesn't just travel from the point of pain to the spine, it travels through many nervous systems then to the spine and brain.
    Acute pain happens more often and lasts for a short amount of time. It's like stubbing your toe or getting a shot.  On the other hand chronic pain lasts for a long time and hurts a lot more.  Chronic pain is most likely to happen in painful conditions such as cancer, arthritis ect.  Thermal and mechanical pain are very unlikely to happen but are super painful.

101476,15/05/06-11:21:04,15/05/06-11:22:31,Mr. Siebel,Christian Andrew Jahnel,Bee article,"A bumblebee visits a flower, drawn in by the bright colours, the patterns on the petals, and the aromatic promise of sweet nectar. But therefs more to pollination than sight and smell. There is also electricity in the air.

Dominic Clarke and Heather Whitney from the University of Bristol have shown that bumblebees can sense the electric field that surrounds a flower. They can even learn to distinguish between fields produced by different floral shapes, or use them to work out whether a flower has been recently visited by other bees. Flowers arenft just visual spectacles and smelly beacons. Theyfre also electric billboards.

gThis is a big finding,h says Daniel Robert, who led the study. gNobody had postulated the idea that bees could be sensitive to the electric field of a flower.h

Scientists have, however, known about the electric side of pollination since the 1960s, although it is rarely discussed. As bees fly through the air, they bump into charged particles from dust to small molecules. The friction of these microscopic collisions strips electrons from the beefs surface, and they typically end up with a positive charge.

Flowers, on the other hand, tend to have a negative charge, at least on clear days. The flowers themselves are electrically earthed, but the air around them carries a voltage of around 100 volts for every metre above the ground. The positive charge that accumulates around the flower induces a negative charge in its petals.

When the positively charged bee arrives at the negatively charged flower, sparks donft fly but pollen does. gWe found some videos showing that pollen literally jumps from the flower to the bee, as the bee approachesc even before it has landed,h says Robert. The bee may fly over to the flower but at close quarters, the flower also flies over to the bee.

This is old news. As far back as the 1970s, botanists suggested that electric forces enhance the attraction between pollen and pollinators. Some even showed that if you sprinkle pollen over an immobilised bee, some of the falling grains will veer off course and stick to the insect.

But Robert is no botanist. Hefs a sensory biologist. He studies how animals perceive the world around them. When he came across the electric world of bees and flowers, the first question that sprang to mind was: gDoes the bee know anything about this process?h Amazingly, no one had asked the question, much less answered it. gWe read all of the papers,h says Robert. gWe even had one translated from Russian, but no one had made that intellectual leap.h

To answer the question, Robert teamed up with Clarke (a physicist) and Whitney (a botanist), and created e-flowers\artificial purple-topped blooms with designer electric fields. When bumblebees could choose between charged flowers that carried a sugary liquid, or charge-less flowers that yielded a bitter one, they soon learned to visit the charged ones with 81 percent accuracy. If none of the flowers were charged, the bees lost the ability to pinpoint the sugary rewards.

But the bees can do more than just tell if an electric field is there or not. They can also discriminate between fields of different shapes, which in turn depend on the shape of a flowerfs petals and how easily they conduct electricity. Clarke and Whitney visualised these patterns by spraying flowers with positively charged and brightly coloured particles. You can see the results below. Each flower has been sprayed on its right half, and the rectangular boxes show the colours of the particles.The bees can sense these patterns. They can learn to tell the difference between an e-flower with an evenly spread voltage and one with a field like a bullseye with 70 percent accuracy.

Bees can also use this electric information to bolster what their other senses are telling them. The team trained bees to discriminate between two e-flowers that came in very slightly different shades of green. They managed it, but it took them 35 visits to reach an accuracy of 80 percent. If the team added differing electric fields to the flowers, the bees hit the same benchmark within just 24 visits.

How does the bee actually register electric fields? No one knows, but Robert suspects that the fields produce small forces that move some of the beefs body parts, perhaps the hairs on its body. In the same way that a rubbed balloon makes you hair stand on end, perhaps a charged flower provides a bee with detectable tugs and shoves.

The bees, in turn, change the charge of whatever flower they land upon. Robertfs team showed that the electrical potential in the stem of a petunia goes up by around 25 millivolts when a bee lands upon it. This change starts just before the bee lands, which shows that itfs nothing to do with the insect physically disturbing the flower. And it lasts for just under two minutes, which is longer than the bee typically spends on its visit.

This changing field can tell a bee whether a flower has been recently visited, and might be short of nectar. Itfs like a sign that says gClosed for business. Be right back.h Itfs also a much more dynamic signal than more familiar ones like colour, patterns or smells. All of these are fairly static. Flowers can change them, but it takes minutes or hours to do so. Electric fields, however, change instantaneously whenever a bees lands. They not only provide useful information, but they do it immediately.

Robert thinks that these signals could either be honest or dishonest, depending on the flower. Those that carpet a field and require multiple visits from pollinators will evolve to be truthful, because they cannot afford to deceive their pollinators.  Bees are good learners and if they repeatedly visit an empty flower, they will quickly avoid an entire patch. Worse still, theyfll communicate with their hive-mates, and the entire colony will seek fresh pastures. gIf the flower can signal that it is momentarily empty, then the bee will benefit and the flower will communicate honestly its mitigated attraction,h says Robert.

But some flowers, like tulips or poppies, only need one or two visits to pollinate themselves.  gThese could afford to lie,h says Robert. He expects that they will do everything possible to keep their electric charge constant, even if a bee lands upon them. They should always have their signs flipped to gOpenh. Robertfs students will be testing this idea in the summer.

Many animals can sense electric fields, including sharks and rays, electric fish, at least one species of dolphin, and the platypus. But this is the first time that anyone has discovered this sense in an insect. And in the humble bumblebee, no less! Bees and flowers have been studied intensely for decades, maybe centuries, and it turns out that theyfve been exchanging secret messages all this time.

Now, Robertfs team is going to take their experiments from the lab into the field, to see just how electrically sensitive wild bees can be, and how their senses change according to the weather. gWe are probably only seeing the tip of the electrical iceberg here,h he says.

Red; 11 out of 12 people sorted Red correctly .

Yellow: 4 out of 12 people sorted Yellow correctly.

Blue:9 out of 12 people sorted Blue correctly 




Green and Yellow were the lightest colors and they were the hardest to sort the different shades. The lighter the color the harder the shades of that color are to sort.
Red and Blue were the darker colors and they were the easiest to sort. The darker the color the easier it is to see the different shades.

If the colors are darker than you can see the different shades of that color easier  but if the color is lighter then its harder to sort the different shades.  "

  I have found out that the top layer of ice that is one molecule thick is called the quasi-fluid layer. the reason I mention this is because apparently the molecules in this layer of the ice vibrate up and down really fast so the ice is slippery. Were ushly ice molecules don't vibrate up and down as fast as they do in the quasi-fluid layer because the ice is a solid figure. So the molecules don't move as much. 
  Ice temperatures for the different ice skating events actually do very a good amount. Like for most Olympic speed skating rinks the ice is ushly an inch thick and 21oF, were for figure skating the ice is ushly 23oF, and for hockey the ice is ushly 23oF as well. The reason there are different temperatures are because the different types of skating need different things. "

   Originally people thought that the reason the ice was slippery was because when you put pressure on the skate blade it melted the ice a little. Though now I have found out that really the ice is slippery because of the top layer of ice that is one molecule thick that is called the quasi-fluid layer vibrates up and down at really high speeds which lets the skate blade go over it almost effortlessly. 
   Also the different skating events have different ice temperatures. Though all of the ice skating events have ice that is one inch thick the ice for speed skating is 21oF were the ice for figure skating and ice hockey is 23oF, this is because the ice for speed skating gets very beat up when you skate on the same ice over and over so they put water on the ice and it has to freeze fast so there is a level playing field. Where in figure skating they have the entire ice rink to skate on. Also in hockey there are intermissions between each mach wear the officials re-do the ice rink. "

   Originally people thought that the reason the ice was slippery was because when you put pressure on the skate blade it melted the ice a little. Though now I have found out that really the ice is slippery because of the top layer of ice that is one molecule thick that is called the quasi-fluid layer vibrates up and down at really high speeds which lets the skate blade go over it almost effortlessly. 
   Also the different skating events have different ice temperatures. Though all of the ice skating events have ice that is one inch thick the ice for speed skating is 21oF were the ice for figure skating and ice hockey is 23oF, this is because the ice for speed skating gets very beat up when you skate on the same ice over and over so they put water on the ice and it has to freeze fast so there is a level playing field. Where in figure skating they have the entire ice rink to skate on. Also in hockey there are intermissions between each mach wear the officials re-do the ice rink. "

Our Question:  How much memory can your cerebellum hold?
Our Hypothesis: The more objects there is the harder it is to remember.
Materials:  Cards
Procedures: We put out 3 cards and let our volenteer memorise the cards for 10 seconds.  Then we had them face the clock and say the cards in the same order they saw them in.  Then we kept adding more card to see how many they could remember.
Results: Kids- Sophia got 9, Will got 7, Savannah got 9, Justin got 7, Daniella 7, Sareena 5, Danny got 9, Tristin got 9, Connor got 9, Anish got 7, Lizzie got 11, Hannah 5, Tanuska got 7,  Josh got 3, Issac got 7, Andrew got 9, Adults-Ms. B got 14 and Ms. R got 16.

Myelin is made of with membranes that shield the axon underneath. A membrane is an outer cover of a cell.  The insulation from the membranes allows the signals to go faster.
Demyelination is when myelin is worn away or damaged and the nerves don't work as well. Causes of this can be inflammation, infection with certain viruses, metabolic problems, loss of oxygen, and physical compression. Metabolic disorders occur when abnormal chemical reactions in your body disrupt metabolism. Metabolism is the process your body uses to get or make energy from food. Myelin is a very important part of the nervous system.  "

-The brain controls all of it every part of your body.
-Nerves are made of nerons and nerons are what send messages to and from body parts.
 -The brain is about the size of a cantilope it weighs about 3 pounds or 1.4 kilograms.
-There are lots of folds and wrinkles in the brain and each one stands for a different memory.
-Between the scull and the brain is a thin layer of liquod for more protection.
-The three main parts of the brain are the cerebrum, cerebellum, and the brain stem.
-The cerebrums job is to think and it controls the things we do on porpose.
-The cerebrum is also the largest part of the brain.
- The cerebrum is also broken up into two sections the right half and the left half.
-The ceribrlum is the second largest part of the brain.
-The cerebrum and the cerebellum work together alot.
-The brain stems job is to connect the brain to the spinal cord.

The lungs are organs in your body. An organ called the diaphragm makes the lungs expand and deflate.

How does the diaphragm assist the lungs to expand and deflate

I predict that the air pushes the diaphragm out and also the ribcage

The Materials I used was:
Half of a big soda bottle( use the top part of the bottle)
A balloon
2 rubber bands( one big one and one small one)
2 big cut pieces of a shopping bag

1: put the balloon through the bottom of the bottle
2: put the lip of the balloon over the top of the bottle 
3: then put the 2 cut pieces of the shopping bags over the bottom of the bottle
4: put the 2 rubber over the 2 cut pieces shopping bags

The results of my experiment is when the diaphragm expands because the air is pushing the diaphragm out, as well as the ribcage ( my prediction was right)

The diaphragm expands the lungs because the air pushes the diaphragm out when you breathe in, and when you breathe out, the diaphragm and lungs wiil deflate
"
111418,15/05/21-08:40:38,15/06/02-09:09:19,Mrs. Murphy,Kendra Caroline Burke,Expirment,"  I know that when you blind folded it's a little hard to find out what you are touching or feeling with your fingers.

 How long does it take to find out what the object is and will people get the objects right.

 I think the soft object will be easier to find out then the hard, stringy, rough objects.

 soft object, hard object, sstringy object and, rough object.

 Step 1. Put bind fold on some one. Step 2. Let them feel 1 object. Step 3.feel object 2. Step 4. feel object 3. Step 5. feel  the last object. Step 6. ask them what they thought it was. Step 7. take off the blind fold and tell them what they got right and wrong.  

My Results were not too bad. 7 out of 8 people got the soft object correct. 1 out of 8 people got the soft object incorrect.6 out of 8 people got the hard object correct.2 out of 8 people got the hard object incorrect.8 out of 8 got the rough object correct. 0 out of 8 got the hard object incorrect. 1 out of 8 people got the stringy object correct. 7 out of 8 got the stringy object incorrect.

In conclusion, I think that the rough object was the easiest to figure out and the stringy object was the most difficult to figure out.

Would it be way easier than it was to figure out the object if I described one part of them.

 i think... that your hand and your foot are more sensitive then your arm and your for-arm.

 to conduct my experiment i use...
. five paper clips
. ruler
 
 1 close there eyes 2 place on arm 3ask them ''how many points did you feel'' 4 record in note book.

 half of the boys for the half cm felt 2 points but the other half felt 1. every boy felt 2 points on there hand for half cm. three fourths of the boys felt 2 points but one of the boys felt 1 point for the palm. every boy for index finger felt 2 points. for half cm for girls. for the arm every girl felt 1 point. for the hand every girl felt 2 points but one girl that felt 1 point. for the palm three fourths of them 2 points and the rest felt 1 point. for the index finger everyone felt 2 points.

 the index finger felt 2 points because it is one of the most sensitive parts of your body. then the palm was the next sensitive part then the hand and then the arm.

My Question I wonder how fast my classmates can identify illusions.
My Hypothesis My guess is that it takes 30 seconds or 1 minute to see the illusion.
Materials I will use a laptop and a classmate.
Procedures I follow these steps, I sit at my desk with a computer, ask a person to try my test.
Results Ian Zhang: 0 second, Toby Thomas: 10 seconds, Inanc Ozbay: 15 seconds, Joshua Jerome: 25 seconds, Ryan Schwartz: 35 seconds
Conclusion I found out that some people practice and so it's 0-20 seconds for some people and 30 seconds to 1 minute for some people.

-Vertebrae is a layer of bone that goes around your spinal cord to pretect it.
-The main job of the nerves system is to keep you alive or living.  Without it you would not be alive.
-If you need to have you message sent to your body quicker then normal,(like if you touch something hot and need to take your hand away) there are special nerves that make messages without going through the body.  
This is all  that is about the brain, nerves system, and all of there parts working together.

 We know that bacteria is everywhere, on door knobs, kitchen sink, money, remotes, your skin.  Bacteria grows in places that people touch and use.  There are different types of bacteria.  Bacteria can grow inside your body and make you sick, it can multiply and mutate adapting to your bodies defenses so that it cannot be killed by the white blood cells.  Some bacteria can help you because it can fight off other bacteria and strengthen your body's defenses.

 
  Which locations around the school will have the most bacteria on them:  door handle, laptop keyboard, bathroom toilet handle, classroom water fountain handle, lunch count pen?    Will wiping each location with a disinfectant wipe change the amount of bacteria?


 We believe that the door handle and the laptop keyboard will have the most bacteria present.  We think that wiping the location with disinfectant wipes will kill most of the bacteria, but some bacteria might still grow.



 10 sterile petri dishes
  nutrient agar in each dish
  10 Q-tips for gathering samples
  Lysol disinfectant wipes



1)  wipe each location 3 times with the Q-tip, then rub the Q-tip across the petri dish with nutrient agar.  Repeat for each location.

2)  Wipe each location with a Lysol disinfectant wipe 3 times, wait for the area to dry.  Then rub the Q-tip across the area 3 times and rub the Q-tip across the petri dish with nutrient agar.

3) Observe the petri dishes each day for one week.  Record the number of bacteria colonies in each dish on a table.  Take photos daily of each petri dish.

My suggesion for the future is keep your notes organized and take alot of notes they come in handy. Also make sure your understanding what your reading some science text can be tricky. I really liked science this year!!"

116625,15/06/24-09:19:22,15/06/24-09:30:12,Mrs. Kirk,Snigdha Arige,suggestions for the future,"My favorite part of science is the science symposium. It was fun to experience other kids experiments. I liked when parents can come in and watch you. They also ask you questions on what you presented. My suggestions for the future is that in science you can choose whatever you want to study about and choose something that you wanted to study about. "
116651,15/06/24-09:22:33,15/06/24-09:34:43,Mrs. Kirk,Ansh Garg,Science Likes and Suggestions,"I like many things about science. I especially like the freedom that we have in researching. We get to work on whatever topic we want individually and not as a class. I also like the fact that we can conduct experiments whenever we want. To be honest, I don't think that there should be any changes to what we are doing now. My only suggestion is to make the Science Symposium preparation start earlier. We had 2 weeks, but should be like 3-4 weeks so kids don't have pressure on them and can show everything they have learned this year. These are my likes and suggestions for the study of science in the future."
116657,15/06/24-09:23:20,15/06/24-09:27:17,Mrs. Kirk,Cadence Bethany Brewer,Science ,"What I like about science is that we could do any topic with any group.
What I recommend for people next year is make sure you read your notes and work together and you will discover great things"
